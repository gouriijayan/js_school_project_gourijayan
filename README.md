# Timeline Web App
# Stage 1:Static HTML Skeleton

This project is a basic timeline web app. The current stage focuses only on the static layout and semantic structure, without any interactivity or styling logic.

# What is included:

- A `<header>` containing:
  - A title (`My Timeline`)
  - A styled `<div>` as a placeholder for a logo
  - A "Theme" toggle button (non-functional for now)

- A `<nav>` element that holds placeholders for future filters.

- A `<main>` section with:
  - A `<section id="timeline">` where timeline events will be displayed.
  - One example `<article>` with a title, image placeholder, and description.

- An empty `<div id="modal">` which will be used later for event popups.

- A `<footer>` with creator credit.

# Semantic HTML tags used are:

- `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`

This structure sets up the foundation for future development stages where interactivity, dynamic content, and styling will be added.
